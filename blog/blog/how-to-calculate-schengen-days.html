        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>The Schengen 90/180 rule confuses almost every traveller who encounters it for the first time. Even experienced travellers who have visited Europe many times get it wrong. The consequences of miscalculating are serious — fines up to €5,000 and entry bans lasting years.</p>

            <p>This guide explains exactly how the calculation works, walks through real worked examples, highlights the most common mistakes, and shows you how to check your remaining days instantly using our free calculator.</p>

            <h2>The Basic Rule: What 90/180 Actually Means</h2>
            <p>Non-EU citizens from countries like the UK, USA, Canada, and Australia can spend a maximum of 90 days in the Schengen Area within any 180-day period. This sounds simple but the phrase "within any 180-day period" is where most people go wrong.</p>

            <p>The 180-day window is rolling, not fixed. It does not reset at the start of each year or each calendar month. Instead, on any given day that you want to enter Schengen, the system looks backwards exactly 180 days from that date and counts every day you spent inside Schengen during that period. If the total is 90 or fewer, you can enter. If it is more than 90, you cannot.</p>

            <p>Both the day you enter and the day you exit count as full days. A trip from Monday to Friday counts as five days, not four, even though you only spend four nights.</p>

                <h3>Calculate Your Days Instantly</h3>
                <p>Don't do this by hand — use our free EES-compliant calculator. Add your trips and get your remaining days in seconds.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Calculate Your Days</h2>
            <p>To calculate your remaining Schengen days manually, follow these steps precisely.</p>

            <p>First, identify the date you want to enter Schengen. This is your reference date. Count back exactly 180 days from this reference date. This gives you the start of your rolling window.</p>

            <p>Next, look at all the trips you have made to Schengen countries within this 180-day window. For each trip, count every day including the day of arrival and the day of departure. Add all these days together.</p>

            <p>Finally, subtract your total from 90. The result is how many days you have remaining. If the result is zero or negative, you cannot enter Schengen on your reference date.</p>

            <h2>Worked Example 1: Simple Case</h2>
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Scenario: Sarah wants to visit Italy in June 2026</h4>
                <p>Sarah's reference date is 1 June 2026. Her 180-day window runs from 3 December 2025 to 1 June 2026.</p>
                <p>During this period, Sarah made one trip: she visited France from 10 January to 25 January 2026. That is 16 days (counting both arrival and departure day).</p>
                <p>Sarah's remaining days: 90 - 16 = <strong>74 days remaining</strong></p>
                <p>Sarah can safely visit Italy for up to 74 days starting 1 June 2026. ✅</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Worked Example 2: Multiple Trips</h2>
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Scenario: James is a digital nomad who visited Europe several times</h4>
                <p>James wants to enter Spain on 1 March 2026. His 180-day window runs from 2 September 2025 to 1 March 2026.</p>
                <p>During this period, James made three trips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trip 1: Germany, 15 September to 30 September 2025 = 16 days</li>
                    <li>Trip 2: France, 1 November to 30 November 2025 = 30 days</li>
                    <li>Trip 3: Italy, 5 January to 20 January 2026 = 16 days</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total days used: 16 + 30 + 16 = 62 days</p>
                <p>James's remaining days: 90 - 62 = <strong>28 days remaining</strong></p>
                <p>James can visit Spain for up to 28 days starting 1 March 2026. ✅</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Worked Example 3: The Dangerous Case</h2>
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Scenario: Emma nearly overstays without realising</h4>
                <p>Emma wants to visit Amsterdam on 1 April 2026. Her 180-day window runs from 3 October 2025 to 1 April 2026.</p>
                <p>During this period, Emma made two long trips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trip 1: Spain (winter holiday), 1 October to 31 December 2025 — but only 90 days of this fall within her window (3 October to 31 December = 90 days)</li>
                    <li>Trip 2: France, 15 February to 15 March 2026 = 29 days</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total days used: 90 + 29 = 119 days</p>
                <p>Emma's remaining days: 90 - 119 = <strong>-29 days (OVER LIMIT)</strong></p>
                <p>Emma cannot enter the Netherlands on 1 April 2026. She will be refused at the border. ❌</p>
            </div>

            <div class="danger-box">
                <strong>⚠️ Emma's Mistake:</strong> Emma thought her Spain trip didn't count because it was in the "previous year." Under the rolling window rule, any days within the last 180 days count regardless of which calendar year they fall in.
            </div>

            <h2>The 5 Most Common Mistakes</h2>

            <h3>Mistake 1: Thinking the Rule Resets Every Year</h3>
            <p>The 90/180 rule does not reset on 1 January. The window is always rolling. Days you spent in Schengen in October, November, or December of the previous year count towards your current allowance if they fall within the last 180 days.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 2: Not Counting Entry and Exit Days</h3>
            <p>Both the day you arrive and the day you depart count as full Schengen days. Many travellers count only the nights they spend, which leads to undercounting. If you fly in on Monday and fly out on Friday, that is five days, not four.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 3: Thinking Different Countries Have Separate Limits</h3>
            <p>There is no separate 90-day allowance for France and another for Germany. All Schengen countries share one combined limit of 90 days. A week in Paris and a week in Berlin uses 14 days of your single 90-day allowance.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 4: Believing Leaving for One Day Resets the Clock</h3>
            <p>This is one of the most dangerous myths about the Schengen rule. Leaving Schengen for one day and returning the next day does not reset anything. Your history remains in the rolling window. Only the passage of time removes days from your count — specifically, when trips fall outside the 180-day lookback window.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 5: Not Accounting for Future Trips</h3>
            <p>When planning a trip, you need to count not just your past visits but also count the days of the planned trip itself. If you have 30 days remaining and you want to stay for 35 days, you will overstay by 5 days even if you were fully compliant when you arrived.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Always calculate your days for your entire planned trip before you book flights. Use our calculator to add your planned dates and see your remaining days after the trip is complete.
            </div>

            <h2>When Do Old Days "Fall Out" of the Window?</h2>
            <p>Days from past trips only stop counting once they fall outside the 180-day rolling window. This happens naturally over time. If you spent 30 days in France in January, those days will stop counting approximately six months later, in July.</p>

            <p>This is why many frequent travellers to Europe time their trips carefully. By waiting until enough of their previous days have fallen outside the 180-day window, they can legally return to Schengen without having exceeded their allowance.</p>

            <h2>How EES Changed Enforcement in 2026</h2>
            <p>Before EES launched in April 2026, the 90/180 rule was enforced by border guards manually counting passport stamps. This system had gaps — stamps were sometimes missed, and travellers could theoretically claim a stamp was incorrect.</p>

            <p>EES eliminated all of this. Every entry and exit is now recorded digitally with biometric verification. The system calculates your remaining days automatically, instantly, and accurately. There is no arguing with the database.</p>

            <p>If the EES system shows you have exceeded your 90 days, you will be refused entry. The border guard has no discretion to override the system's calculation. This makes accurate day-tracking more important than ever before.</p>

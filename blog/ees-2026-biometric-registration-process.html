<h1>Estonian Electronic Residency (EER) and EES 2026 Biometric Registration Process: What You Need to Know</h1>

<h2>Introduction to EER and EES</h2>

Since March 2023, the European Union has required long-stay visa holders to apply for an Electronic Residence Permit (e-residency) and Electronic Travel Authorisation (EES) upon entry into the EU, rather than a traditional visa sticker in their passport. The Electronic Travel Authorisation process, which was fully implemented in the EU in 2023, has a biometric registration process to track the arrival and stay of non-EU nationals. In this article, we will be discussing the EER and EES 2026 biometric registration process.

<h2>The EES Biometric Registration Process: What You Need to Know</h2>

Once arriving in the EU, long-stay visa holders must register for EER through the EU's EES system. To do this, they will need to:

- Register their biometric information, which can be done at the airport of entry into the EU, at an external Schengen border crossing point or at a designated application center.
- Obtain an EES registration sticker or an E-residence permit from the border authorities at their point of entry to prove that they have been granted an EER and EES.

In addition to this, the EES system also requires long-stay visa holders to provide the necessary information, such as their name, date of birth, nationality, and contact details, and to declare their purpose and intended length of stay in the EU.

<h2>How Long Does the Process Take?</h2>

The time it takes to complete the registration process can vary depending on the location and the workload of the authorities handling EES applications. Generally, registration at an external Schengen border crossing point can take several minutes, however, long-stay visa holders traveling by air may encounter longer waiting times at the airport, especially during peak travel periods.

If the visa holder is unable to register their biometric information at the point of entry, they will need to do so at a designated application center at a later time. The EES registration process can take up to 10 working days, though some countries and airports may offer quicker alternatives.

<h2>Preparation is Key for a Smooth Registration</h2>

To avoid delays and ensure a smooth registration process, long-stay visa holders are advised to:

- Check with the relevant authorities in the EU country you intend to visit to confirm the requirements for EER and EES registration for your nationality and the type of visa you hold.
- Ensure that you have all the necessary documentation required for EER and EES registration, including your passport and visa.
- Plan ahead and register for EER as early as possible upon entry into the EU.

If you're unsure about any aspect of the EER or EES biometric registration process, you can consult the official European Union (EU) website or visit a trusted immigration advisor for personalized guidance.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In conclusion, the EER and EES biometric registration process can seem complex at first, but with the right information and preparation, long-stay visa holders can ensure a smooth registration process and enjoy their stay in the EU. Always plan ahead and consult with relevant authorities or immigration advisors for the most accurate information and personalized guidance.
